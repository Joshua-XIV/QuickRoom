# QuickRoom

This is a personal project focused on learning and integrating WebSockets and WebRTC, as well as deploying both the backend and frontend to the web. The UI is intentionally simple, as the primary goal was to gain hands-on experience with real-time communication and full-stack deployment.


**Current Features:**  

Create a room for up to 20 users  
Text Chat, Audio, and Video  
Can set passwords for your rooms  
Can set your room to be private to avoid being on the Browse list

**Known Bugs:** 

Sometimes have to mute/unmute audio/video to see/hear others
